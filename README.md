# PokieTicker — Understand the "Why" Behind Every Price Move

**🔗 Live Demo: [mitrui.com/PokieTicker](https://mitrui.com/PokieTicker/)** | [![Buy Me A Coffee](https://img.shields.io/badge/Buy%20Me%20A%20Coffee-support-yellow?logo=buymeacoffee)](https://buymeacoffee.com/mitrui)

Since I wanted to understand the stories behind candlestick charts, I vibe coded this app.

As a stock market beginner, the news was too fragmented and I was wasting a lot of time, never understanding why prices went up or down. I built PokieTicker to develop **event-driven thinking** — to understand the "why" behind every price move.

## What It Does

- **News on the chart** — Dots on the candlestick chart represent news for each date. Click any dot to see the news impacting that company at the time.
- **Filter by impact type** — Market, earnings, product, policy, competition, or management. Click a category to see related bullish or bearish news.
- **Find similar events** — Discover historical days with similar news patterns and see what happened to the stock afterward.
- **AI explains price moves** — Select a date range and ask AI why the stock dropped or rallied. It tells you what events caused it.
- **Predict trends** — Based on the past 30 days of news events, the model predicts how these events might affect future price direction.

## How the Prediction Works

PokieTicker includes an XGBoost-based prediction system that combines news sentiment with technical indicators:

**Features (31 total):**
- **News features** — article count, sentiment score, positive/negative ratio, 3/5/10-day rolling averages, sentiment momentum
- **Technical features** — price returns (1/3/5/10-day), volatility, volume ratio, RSI-14, moving average crossover

**How it works:**
1. News articles are scored for sentiment by Claude Haiku (batch API) — each article gets a sentiment label, key discussion summary, and bullish/bearish reasons
2. These are combined with OHLC price data into daily feature vectors
3. XGBoost classifiers predict up/down direction at T+1, T+3, and T+5 horizons
4. The system also finds historically similar periods (cosine similarity on feature vectors) and shows what happened next

**Why news-driven prediction can work:**
- Stock prices are driven by information. Major news events (earnings, policy changes, product launches) create predictable short-term momentum
- Sentiment clustering matters — when multiple negative articles cluster on the same day, the downward pressure tends to persist for 1-3 days
- Historical pattern matching works because markets react similarly to similar events (e.g., tariff announcements, FDA approvals, earnings beats)

> This is an experimental tool for learning, not financial advice. Markets are complex and no model captures everything.

## Architecture

```
Frontend (React + Vite + D3.js)          Backend (FastAPI + SQLite)
+---------------------------------+      +----------------------------+
|  CandlestickChart (D3.js)       |      |  /api/stocks/{sym}/ohlc    |
|  +- news dots on each date      |----->|  /api/news/{sym}?date=     |
|  +- crosshair + click to lock   |      |  /api/news/{sym}/categories|
|                                  |      |                            |

|  +- sentiment sorted             |      |  +- ohlc (51K+ rows)      |

+---------------------------------+      +----------------------------+
```

## Data Pipeline

```
Polygon API --> Layer 0 (rule filter) --> Layer 1 (Haiku Batch API) --> Layer 2 (Sonnet, on-demand)
  OHLC + News    reject spam/listicles    sentiment + up/down reasons     deep analysis on click
                  ~17% rejected            50 articles per batch call      cached in DB
```

## Quick Start

The repo includes a pre-built database (`pokieticker.db`) with historical data, so you can run it immediately — **no API keys needed**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/owengetinfo-design/PokieTicker.git
cd PokieTicker

# Unpack the pre-built database and models
gunzip -k pokieticker.db.gz
tar xzf models.tar.gz -C backend/ml/

# Backend (Python 3.10+)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend (Node.js 18+)
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
```

Then start both services (in two terminal windows):

```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn backend.api.main:app --reload

# Terminal 2: Frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:7777/PokieTicker/** and you're done.

### Updating data (optional)

If you want to fetch the latest stock data and run AI analysis, you'll need API keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and fill in your keys:
```

| Key | Where to get it | Cost |
|-----|-----------------|------|
| `POLYGON_API_KEY` | [polygon.io](https://polygon.io/) | Free tier |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/) | Pay-as-you-go |

```bash
# Fetch new OHLC + news
python -m backend.bulk_fetch

# Run AI analysis
python -m backend.batch_submit --top 50
python -m backend.batch_collect <batch_id>
```
